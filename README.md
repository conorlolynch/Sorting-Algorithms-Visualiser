# Sorting-Algorithms-Visualiser
GUI which visualizes the sorting process of popular sorting algorithms such as Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort and Quick Sort. 

## Getting Started

To get started just run the sorting_algorithms.py file (Pyhton 3.5+ required). Once the GUI pops up pick a sorting algorithm and the size of the array and hit start to watch the algorithm begin sorting. 

### Prerequisites

Following modules are required to run this program:

```
pygame==1.9.6
numpy==1.18.4
threaded==4.0.8
```

## Usage

To get the visualiser running choose an algorithm from the algorithm drop down menu. From there choose the size of the array to be sorted. The speed of the algorithm can be adjusted by moving the speed slider in either direction. 

### Demonstration

TO BE ADDED

### Additional Information

- This program uses threading to be able to adjust sorting speed while the sorting algorithm is running as well as being able to stop the algorithm mid sort.

### Desired Features
- Make GUI prettier.
- Add feature to import and export files of numbers to take in and sort.
